The Real-Time Weather Predictor is a web application that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for any location worldwide. It uses a live weather API to fetch current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions, along with a short-term forecast. The project features an intuitive user interface where users can search by city name or location coordinates, and instantly receive weather updates.

Key features include:

Live Data Fetching – Uses a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) for real-time weather updates.

Search Functionality – Get weather data for any global location.

Dynamic UI – Displays temperature, weather conditions, and icons based on live data.

Responsive Design – Works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Forecast Support – Optional integration to show hourly or multi-day weather predictions.

This project is ideal for learning how to integrate APIs, handle asynchronous JavaScript requests, and present live data in a user-friendly way. It can be extended with additional features such as location-based detection, weather alerts, and historical weather trends.
